    <h1><strong>Lore of Dark Souls III</strong></h1>
    <p>Dark Souls 3 is the third installment of the Dark Souls series made by FromSoftware.</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>Game starts as the Ashen One is brought back to life to link the fire once again.
      Gameplay resembles Dark Souls 1, but with a few improvements. The player needs to defeat <em>Lords of Cinder</em>
      to offer their souls to <strong>Soul of Cinder</strong> Linking the First Flame.
      <br>
      Cool fact about Soul of Cinder is, he is the Chosen Undead. The main protagonist of <acronym title="Dark Souls 1">DS1</acronym>.
      The hardest boss in the game is <del>The Nameless King</del> <ins>Darkeater Midir</ins>.
      A good way to learn more about the lore there is a book called <cite>Abyssal Archives: Mythology of Dark Souls</cite> by Lokey.

      "There is one thing that you should know. There is a darkness within man, and I am afraid you will peer into it.
      Whether the fear will spark self-reflection, or a ruinous nostalgia... is up to you entirely. Fear not, your
      choice will bring you no scorn." - <abbr title="Pyromancer">Pyro</abbr> Karla
