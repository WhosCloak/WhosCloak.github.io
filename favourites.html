    <p>Welcome to my Favourites.</p>
    <p>My favourite games are SoulsBorne and Souls-like games.
      I got into souls games with Elden Ring, and I've been a fan ever since.
      I like rock and metal bands like Metallica.
      I listened to rock and metal ever since I was a kid because my parents listened to it.
      My favourite movie is Ready Player One.
      I watched it over and over during the Covid-19 lockdown.
